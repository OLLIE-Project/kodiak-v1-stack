# Kodiak v1  
*A modular engine for contextual data correlation and archival integrity.*

---

## Overview
**Kodiak v1** is the first iteration of a long-term effort to build a distributed data-processing framework focused on **context, verifiability, and ethical automation**.

It’s designed to collect and transform heterogeneous information streams into durable, structured archives that can be analyzed and revisited with full traceability.  
Every artifact that enters the system retains a cryptographic lineage — from initial acquisition to final analytical output.

Kodiak doesn’t chase volume. It prioritizes **interpretability and reproducibility**, making it suitable for projects where reliability, provenance, and long-term access matter more than raw throughput.

---

## Core Principles
1. **Traceability**  
   Every transformation and decision is recorded. Data lineage is built-in, not bolted-on.

2. **Integrity**  
   Artifacts are immutable once archived. New versions are derived transparently through controlled, auditable processes.

3. **Context Before Volume**  
   Kodiak values high-quality, interpretable data over indiscriminate accumulation.

4. **Ethical Automation**  
   Operations are rate-limited, privacy-respecting, and transparent by default.

## Architecture
Kodiak is composed of cooperative subsystems communicating over an internal event bus:

- **Ingest & Orchestration** – Handles initial retrieval, validation, and claim-checking, producing verifiable archive packages.  
- **Processing & Sanitization** – Normalizes, enriches, and cleans data while preserving provenance.  
- **Correlation Engine** – Links entities, events, and relationships into a coherent analytical graph.  
- **Ledger Layer** – Provides durable metadata storage, version control, and full audit history.  
- **Interface Layer** – A minimal API and GUI for oversight, inspection, and reproducible querying.

Each subsystem is self-contained and implemented in memory-safe languages for reliability under sustained workloads.

---

## Design Goals
- **Reproducible analytics** – every conclusion can be traced back to its origin.  
- **Durable archives** – open formats, verifiable storage.  
- **Extensibility** – new modules can be added without disturbing the core system.  
- **Transparency** – clear, documented workflows for every operation.

---

## Intended Use
Kodiak is aimed at **researchers and archivists** who need to handle complex, cross-referenced datasets responsibly.  
It is **not** a tool for indiscriminate collection or exposure; its design enforces accountability and auditability at every stage.

> **Status:**  
> Kodiak v1 represents the *foundation* — the first functional iteration of an evolving system.  
> Future versions will expand analytical depth, scalability, and data-model sophistication while maintaining the same ethical and architectural principles.
